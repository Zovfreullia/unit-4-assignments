**Factorial** [source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p154669)   
Given `n` of 1 or more, return the factorial of `n`, which is `n * (n-1) * (n-2) ... 1`. Compute the result recursively (without loops).

**Bunny Ears** [source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p183649)  
We have a number of bunnies and each bunny has two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively (without loops or multiplication). 

*Example:*  
bunnyEars(0) → 0  
bunnyEars(1) → 2  
bunnyEars(2) → 4
